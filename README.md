You can call me Purple 

Currently learning roblox studio gameDev and have been for 2 years.
Planning to branch off into other game engines. 

I love indie games: The Binding of Isaac, Bug Fables, Inscryption, Enter the Gungeon, Bloons Tower Defense 6, etc...
I also love playing Minecraft, Apex Legends, and TitanFall 2 

Swords in general are cool.
